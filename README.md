# LocalPhotoSphere

A single static html page to show Photo Spheres

LocalPhotoSphere is a single html static file that allows you to specify a photosphere file and it display it in your browser. Nothing is uploaded to any server. Everything is kept locally in your browser. This works offline if you save the page first.

There's not many bells or whistles and no external dependencies at all.

Pull requests to improve or add functionalities are welcome.


# Minimalism
The entire code is 78 'lines' of code but because of the embedded libraries, it still weights 475KB.
